Anna — Virtual Assistant for Public-Sector Services

**URL**: [Project Link](https://butterrchicken.lovable.app/)

## Project info

Anna is a scalable, multilingual virtual assistant designed for government and public-sector service delivery. The system provides continuous conversational support to residents seeking information on visas, regulations, and municipal services. Its primary objectives are to improve service accessibility, reduce response latency, and decrease operational workload for public institutions.

This project was awarded First Place at the ElevenLabs Worldwide Hackathon (Amsterdam edition), a global, time-constrained innovation challenge focused on developing impactful and scalable conversational AI solutions.

### Problem Statement

Public institutions face increasing demand for timely, accurate, and multilingual citizen support. Existing service channels are often constrained by limited operating hours, language barriers, and high administrative overhead. Anna addresses these challenges by offering an automated, conversational interface capable of handling high volumes of inquiries while maintaining consistent service quality.

System Architecture

Anna is designed as a modular conversational system composed of the following core components:

Voice Interaction Layer
Handles speech input and output, enabling real-time, voice-based user interaction.

Conversational Agent Layer
Manages dialogue flow, intent handling, and response orchestration for public-service use cases.

Presentation Layer
Web-based interface for user access and interaction.

Scalability and Deployment Layer
Supports rapid deployment and horizontal scaling to accommodate varying usage demands.

Knowledge Base
It strictly uses the latest rules, guidelines and regulations pertaining to the residence permit, visas, and some critical services. However, it can be expanded to include more serivces.

### Important Note: Since the bot is very chaty, I have restricted the tokens usage for the application so that I do not get some unexpected spurises for my subscription or I may have ended my subscription.
